## Hello geeks!!! ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I?

I'm a tech enthusiast who would like to explore new technologies, not just programming languages but also devices. I am a highly motivated person who always loves to use Insight, Strategy and Creativity to the challenge of being told â€˜noâ€™ and turning it into a â€˜yes'.Since I'm (still) a full-time Software Engineer, I also like to learn and share my code.
